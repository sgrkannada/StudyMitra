🛠️ How It Works
The app leverages a powerful AI core to deliver its smart features:

Input: The user interacts with the app by inputting a query, uploading a document, or adding an event to their schedule.

Processing: A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the input. For a homework problem, it generates a solution. For a document, it extracts key points to create flashcards or summaries.

Output: The AI delivers the result in a user-friendly format, whether it's a clear explanation, a structured study plan, or a set of digital flashcards.

💻 Tech Stack
Mobile Framework: Flutter / React Native for a seamless cross-platform experience on Android & iOS.

User Interface: Clean, intuitive UI designed for ease of use.

AI Engine: Powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for tutoring and content generation.

Backend: A robust backend using Node.js or Firebase to handle user data and AI integration.

Database: Secure and scalable database like Firestore or PostgreSQL for storing user schedules, notes, and progress.
